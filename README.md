# Basketball Database

  Hello basketball or sports enthusiasts! Welcome to the Basketball Database repository where this repo will contain R code and SQL coding to make the most convenient, up-to-date, and accurate database. I will acknowledge that the data I will provide are being derived directly from Basketball-Reference.com but I thought I can extrapolate the data for those that want to work directly with the basketball data. I recommend checking Basketball-Reference.com as they are a great source for basketball statistics.

  With that out of the way, the following will be provided (or soon to be provided):

NBA Statistics
  League Info, Awards and Team Selections, Standings, Player Stats, Team Stats, and Coaching History
  
ABA - coming soon

WNBA - coming soon

G-League - coming soon

RECOMMENDATION!!

  If you are interested in running the code yourself, keep reading or if you just want to grab the loaded .RDA files of data then go ahead and do so. For those that are reading, please run the Library packages in the 'PACKAGES' file. Then run the URL files in the 'URLS' folder before running any other code. This will allow use to find valid URLs so that we can then scrape later on.
